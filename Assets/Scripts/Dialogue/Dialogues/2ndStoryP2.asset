  dialogue:
  - 'Death is a close friend of humanity.

'
  - "He walks along the footprints of Earth\u2019s people when they come knocking
    at any one else\u2019s proverbial door. \r\n"
  - "Civilizations, planets, and lives are all the same taken swiftly by the invaders
    just as swiftly as Death arrives to carry along their souls. \r"
  - "He may be neutral regarding who he takes, humanity has certainly seen their
    fair share of losses, but Death is but naturally bound to those who survive\u2013"
  - 'To those who win. For those are the ones who will sow the seeds of pain and
    suffering that the reaper shall one day reap.
