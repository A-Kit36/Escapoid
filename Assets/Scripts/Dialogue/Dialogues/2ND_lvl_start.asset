  - You know. I find it funny.
  - ' I once heard that humanity was fearful that they may be the only living species
    in the universe, while also being fearful of the existence of dominating alien
    forces. '
  - "In hindsight you\u2019d wonder if those fears were born from the natural instinct
    of survival,"
  - "or the desire to be that dominant force and, in turn, have others to subjugate
    with that power. \r"
  - "If it\u2019s the latter, then, to everyone else\u2019s dismay, their prayers
    were answered.\r"
